Abstract:
The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem is finding a solution of paths for
multiple agents in a 2D map with no collision at all. At present, CBS is a more
effective method to find the optimal solution. However, CBS algorithm has the
disadvantages of a long time and high memory consumption. By modifying the
algorithm in the high level and low level of CBS, we control the loss of the cost to a
small degree, and greatly reduce the CPU time and memory required for operation
(which is shown by the number of expanded nodes).
